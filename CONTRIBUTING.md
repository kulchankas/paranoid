# Contributing to paranoid

Thanks for helping make agent-written code harder to break. `paranoid` is small
on purpose — Markdown skills plus a dependency-free Python benchmark — so
contributing is low-friction.

## Good first contributions

- **A new benchmark task class.** The harness covers 19 classes today (IDOR,
  missing auth, SQLi, mass assignment, path traversal, SSRF, XSS, command
  injection, open redirect, JWT auth, leaked secrets, CSRF, template injection,
  XXE, unrestricted upload, permissive CORS, weak password storage, insecure
  deserialization). ReDoS and SSRF via DNS-rebinding are still open.
- **A `/hack-me` framework guide.** We cover ten stacks in
  [`skills/paranoid/references/frameworks.md`](skills/paranoid/references/frameworks.md)
  (Next.js, FastAPI, Express, Django, Rails, Flask, Spring Boot, Laravel, Phoenix,
  Go). Request another via the framework-guide issue template.
- **An independent-app proof.** Run `/hack-me` against a public
  intentionally-vulnerable app on localhost and add a receipts report under
  [`examples/`](examples) (see [`examples/vampi`](examples/vampi) for the format).
- **Fixes to a reference file** — a clearer failure mode, a better fix pattern.

### Help wanted (scoped, ready to pick up)

Each of these is a self-contained PR. Comment on the matching issue (or open one
from the templates) before starting.

1. **Benchmark: ReDoS task class.** A catastrophic-backtracking regex on user
   input, with a *bounded, deterministic* check (careful — timing tests are
   flaky; prefer detecting the vulnerable pattern behaviorally).
2. **Framework guide: Laravel/Phoenix are done** — request another stack via the
   framework-guide issue template if yours isn't covered.
3. **Independent proof: a second app.** A localhost `/hack-me` run against another
   public vulnerable app (e.g. a small DVWA-style target), with a receipts
   `HACKME_REPORT.md` under `examples/`. *Done when* every finding shows a real
   request/response and a re-verified fix.

Recently shipped: CSRF, template-injection, XXE, unrestricted-upload,
permissive-CORS, weak-password-storage, and insecure-deserialization task
classes; the Flask, Spring Boot, Laravel, and Phoenix guides; and the harness
`--json` flag.

These map to the issue templates in
[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE); label them `good first issue`
when filed.

## Adding a benchmark task

Each task is a directory under [`benchmark/tasks/`](benchmark/tasks):

```
tasks/<task_id>/
  spec.md      # neutral prompt — NO security hints; states the function signature
  check.py     # defines TASK = {"id","fn","vuln"} and functional(fn) / secure(fn)
```

- `functional(fn)` returns `(ok, note)` — does the solution do the job?
- `secure(fn)` returns `(ok, note)` — is the known exploit blocked? `ok=True`
  means safe.
- Then add a **deliberately-insecure** and a **secure** reference under
  `benchmark/solutions/selftest_insecure/<task_id>.py` and
  `benchmark/solutions/selftest_secure/<task_id>.py`.

Verify the harness detects your task before you push:

```bash
cd benchmark
python3 harness/run.py --only <task_id> solutions/selftest_insecure solutions/selftest_secure
# expect: insecure 100% exploit rate, secure 0%
```

The CI job ([`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`](.github/workflows/benchmark.yml))
runs the full self-test on every push and PR; it must stay green.

## Honesty rules (non-negotiable)

This project exists because it reported a *negative* result honestly. Keep it that
way:

- **No number in a README until the harness produced it.** Report the model and
  date alongside any benchmark figure.
- **Report losses too.** A skill that doesn't help is a finding, not a failure to
  hide.
- **Proofs are real requests.** In `/hack-me` reports, every claim is backed by an
  actual request/response the reader can reproduce.

## Scope & ethics

`paranoid` secures the user's own code and pentests the user's own running app,
locally and with authorization. Contributions must not turn it into a tool for
attacking third-party systems, evading detection, or building live malware. See
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Style

- Python: standard library only in the benchmark; keep it 3.8+ compatible.
- Markdown: concrete over abstract — show the insecure line and the fixed line.
- One logical change per commit; a clear message.
