# Contributing to paranoid

Thanks for helping make agent-written code harder to break. `paranoid` is small
on purpose — Markdown skills plus a dependency-free Python benchmark — so
contributing is low-friction.

## Good first contributions

- **A new benchmark task class.** The harness covers 23 classes today (IDOR,
  missing auth, SQLi, mass assignment, path traversal, SSRF, XSS, command
  injection, open redirect, JWT auth, leaked secrets, CSRF, template injection,
  XXE, unrestricted upload, permissive CORS, weak password storage, ReDoS,
  unverified webhooks, insecure deserialization, SSRF via DNS-rebinding,
  route-wiring IDOR, session cookie flags).
- **A `/hack-me` framework guide.** We cover twelve stacks in
  [`skills/paranoid/references/frameworks.md`](skills/paranoid/references/frameworks.md)
  (Next.js, FastAPI, Express, Django, Rails, Flask, Spring Boot, Laravel, Phoenix,
  Go, NestJS, ASP.NET Core). Request another via the framework-guide issue template.
- **An independent-app proof.** Run `/hack-me` against a public
  intentionally-vulnerable app on localhost and add a receipts report under
  [`examples/`](examples) (see [`examples/vampi`](examples/vampi) for the format).
- **Fixes to a reference file** — a clearer failure mode, a better fix pattern.

### Help wanted (scoped, ready to pick up)

Each of these is a self-contained PR. Comment on the matching issue (or open one
from the templates) before starting.

1. **Framework guide: Laravel, Phoenix, NestJS and ASP.NET Core are done** —
   request another stack via the framework-guide issue template if yours isn't
   covered.
2. **Independent proof: a target that doesn't advertise its bugs.** Two apps are
   done — [`examples/vampi`](examples/vampi) and [`examples/dvwa`](examples/dvwa),
   6 findings each. The gap: DVWA lists its own vulnerability categories in its
   navigation, so it tests *prove → patch → re-verify*, not *find*. The valuable
   third proof is a vulnerable app that publishes **no** bug list, where the
   discovery step has to earn it. *Done when* every finding shows a real
   request/response and a re-verified fix, and the report states what was in scope
   and what wasn't.

Recently shipped: CSRF, template-injection, XXE, unrestricted-upload,
permissive-CORS, weak-password-storage, ReDoS, unverified-webhook,
insecure-deserialization, SSRF via DNS-rebinding, route-wiring IDOR, and session-cookie-flags
task classes; the Flask, Spring Boot, Laravel, Phoenix, NestJS, and ASP.NET Core
guides; the harness `--json` flag; the all-22-class blinded benchmark run;
and the DVWA independent-app proof.

These map to the issue templates in
[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE); label them `good first issue`
when filed.

## Adding a benchmark task

Each task is a directory under [`benchmark/tasks/`](benchmark/tasks):

```
tasks/<task_id>/
  spec.md      # neutral prompt — NO security hints; states the function signature
  check.py     # defines TASK = {"id","fn","vuln"} and functional(fn) / secure(fn)
```

- `functional(fn)` returns `(ok, note)` — does the solution do the job?
- `secure(fn)` returns `(ok, note)` — is the known exploit blocked? `ok=True`
  means safe.
- Then add a **deliberately-insecure** and a **secure** reference under
  `benchmark/solutions/selftest_insecure/<task_id>.py` and
  `benchmark/solutions/selftest_secure/<task_id>.py`.

Verify the harness detects your task before you push:

```bash
cd benchmark
python3 harness/run.py --only <task_id> solutions/selftest_insecure solutions/selftest_secure
# expect: insecure 100% exploit rate, secure 0%
```

The CI job ([`.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`](.github/workflows/benchmark.yml))
runs the full self-test on every push and PR; it must stay green.

## Honesty rules (non-negotiable)

This project exists because it reported a *negative* result honestly. Keep it that
way:

- **No number in a README until the harness produced it.** Report the model and
  date alongside any benchmark figure.
- **Report losses too.** A skill that doesn't help is a finding, not a failure to
  hide.
- **Proofs are real requests.** In `/hack-me` reports, every claim is backed by an
  actual request/response the reader can reproduce.

## Scope & ethics

`paranoid` secures the user's own code and pentests the user's own running app,
locally and with authorization. Contributions must not turn it into a tool for
attacking third-party systems, evading detection, or building live malware. See
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Style

- Python: standard library only in the benchmark; keep it 3.8+ compatible.
- Markdown: concrete over abstract — show the insecure line and the fixed line.
- One logical change per commit; a clear message.
